# Melbourne-Housing-Price-Prediction-App
This project is a web application that predicts house prices based on user inputs such as the number of rooms, location, property type, and other key features. The model was trained using XGBoost, a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm, and deployed using Streamlit, a lightweight framework for creating interactive web applications.
